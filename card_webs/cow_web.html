    <h1>History of cows</h1>
    <p>Domestic cows are one of the most common farm animals around the world, and the English language has several
        words to describe these animals at various ages. A baby cow is called a calf. A female calf is sometimes called
        a heifer calf and a male a bull calf. A heifer is a female that has not had any offspring. The term usually
        refers to immature females; after giving birth to her first calf, however, a heifer becomes a cow. An adult male
        is known as a bull. Many male cattle are castrated to reduce their aggressive tendencies and make them more
        tractable. Young neutered males, which are primarily raised for beef, are called steers or bullocks, whereas
        adult neutered males, which are usually used for draft purposes, are known as oxen. A group of cows, cattle, or
        kine (an archaic term for more than one cow) constitutes a herd. English lacks a gender-neutral singular form,
        and so “cow” is used for both female individuals and all domestic bovines.</p>

    <p>As a part of CSP project we went to ISKCON Goshala and there we met the goshala incharge. We requested the
        incharge to give permission to our project. The incharge accepted our request and granted permission to survey
        the ISKCON Goshala. We met the ISKCON Goshala herdsmen and we discussed with him about the breeds of goshala and
        what are the food given to them. The whole goshala gives 40 liters of milk and it all belongs to ISKCON temple.
        The ISKCON Goshala consists of total 3-4 types of breeds of cows. They are from Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Ongole
        and local breeds. They give milk as per their capacity. We suggested and educated them about some new
        technologies that are used in cattle farming.</p>

    <h1>Habits and Food</h1>
    <p>In part of this we found that these animals are habituated to two types of food culture: food through plants and
        food through nutrients. For today, we decided to know about food culture from plants. So we did a research
        through internet and from an owner of these animals and gathered some knowledge. From the knowledge we gained
        from internet, we educated about the best uses of feeding plants like grass, hay, silage, and vegetables.
        So we researched on the internet and gathered some information from owners of cows and goats. As per our
        knowledge through internet, we suggested them to feed some nutritious food for better health and good milk
        production like corn, wheat, barley, and protein food like soybeans, canola, and other legumes.</p>

    <h1>Diseases and Preventions</h1>
    <h4>Cows can be affected by various diseases, but here are a few common ones and their preventions:</h4>
    <p><b>Bovine Respiratory Disease (BRD):</b> Often occurs after stress such as transportation. Prevention includes
        vaccination, good ventilation, and avoiding overcrowding.<br>
        <b>Foot and Mouth Disease:</b> Highly contagious viral disease. Prevention involves strict biosecurity measures
        and vaccination in some regions.<br>
        <b>Mastitis:</b> Infection of the udder tissue. Prevented by maintaining hygiene during milking, proper
        nutrition, and regular health checks.<br>
        <b>Viral Diarrhea (BVD):</b> Caused by a virus affecting the immune system. Prevention includes vaccination and
        biosecurity protocols.</p>
    <h4>Preventions:</h4>
    <p><b>Respiratory Disease (BRD):</b> Prevention includes vaccination programs, preconditioning, identifying and
        treating subclinically affected animals, and implementing biosecurity measures.<br>
        <b>Foot and Mouth Disease:</b> Control measures include vaccination, culling of infected animals, and strict
        biosecurity measures to prevent spread.<br>
        <b>Mastitis:</b> Preventive measures include maintaining hygiene during milking, proper cow nutrition, dry cow
        therapy, and regular health checks to detect early signs.<br>
        <b>Bovine Viral Diarrhea (BVD):</b> Prevention strategies involve vaccination, biosecurity protocols to prevent
        introduction of the virus, and testing and culling of persistently infected animals.</p>
