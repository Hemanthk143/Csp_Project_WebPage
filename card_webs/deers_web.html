    <h1>History of Deer</h1>
    <p>Deer are graceful, herbivorous mammals belonging to the Cervidae family. They are found in various habitats
        worldwide, from forests and grasslands to tundras and deserts. Deer have been a part of human culture for
        thousands of years, appearing in mythology, art, and literature across different civilizations. They are admired
        for their agility, antlers (present in males of most species), and their role in the ecosystem as herbivores and
        prey animals.</p>

    <p>During our study on deer as part of a conservation project, we visited several natural reserves where deer roam
        freely. We observed their behavior, feeding patterns, and interactions with the ecosystem. Our discussions with
        wildlife experts highlighted the importance of conservation efforts to preserve deer habitats and ensure their
        survival for future generations.</p>

    <h1>Habitat and Diet</h1>
    <p>Deer are adaptable animals found in diverse habitats such as forests, grasslands, and mountainous regions. They
        primarily feed on vegetation such as grasses, leaves, shoots, and fruits. Understanding their dietary needs and
        habitat requirements is crucial for their conservation and management.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Soybeans :are very rich in nutrients and contain up to 40% protein crucial in the diets of deer.</li>
        <li>Grass :compromise less than 10% of a deers diet. It also contains protein. Tough in low amounts.</li>
        <li>Chestnuts :are high in protein and carbohydrates. They are also low in tannins that inhibit digestion.</li>
        <li>Mushrooms :are high in phosphorous and proteins that aid in the growth and development of deer muscles.</li>
        <li>Forbs :are highly digestible and are a rich source of energy, vitamins, and antioxidants.</li>
        <li>Beechnuts :are high in proteins and fats crucial for energy and maintaining body mass in deers.</li>
        <li>Twigs</li>
        <li>Alfalfa :contain protein in small amounts and provide a good supplement for the nutrition of deer.</li>
        <li>Apples and peaches :are palatable for deer and are high in fiber that aid in the digestion of other foods.
        </li>
        <li>Acorns :are rich in protein, carbohydrates, fats, and minerals such as potassium, phosphorous, and calcium.
            They also contain vitamin C, all of which play a big part I the survival of deer.</li>
        <li>Bark :cedar elm, four-wing, and saltbush</li>
        <li>Shoots</li>
        <li>Pecans :are fed on commonly during winter and are high in fat, providing sufficient energy to carry the deer
            throughout the winter season.</li>
        <li>Hickory :aren't very effective to the diets of deer but are fed on as deer find them tasty.</li>
        <li>Persimmons :are also known as deer candy due to their appealing taste and are high in nutrients; starch,
            vitamin C, potassium, iron, phosphorous, iron, and carbohydrates.</li>
        <li>Foliage</li>
        <li>Wild crabapple :though bitter, they contain tannins and have a high nutrition value as well.</li>
        <li>Clover leaves :are a preferred source of food during the winter season, especially the red clovers, which
            are high in nutrients crucial to the deer diet.</li>
        <li>Old Man's Beard :grey lichen, typically found growing on dead spruce and balsam trees high in nutrients and
            essential in deers diet.</li>
        <li>Weeds :dandelions, ragweed, and asters</li>
        <li>Trees :willow, oak and, red cedar are fed on, especially in the winter season. They act as good supplements
            for deer feed.</li>
        <li>Oat :are easily digestible and are rich in crude protein to aid in muscle development in deer.</li>
        <li>Staghorn sumac (a plant) :provides a sufficient amount of nutrients during the winter season. Deer feed on
            their fruits to supplement their diets.</li>
    </ul>

        <b>Climate Change:</b> Impacting habitat and food availability.
    </p>
    <h4>Conservation efforts include:</h4>
