    <h1>History of Dogs</h1>
    <p>Dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) have been loyal companions to humans for thousands of years. Their domestication is believed to have begun over 15,000 years ago, making them one of the first animals to be domesticated by humans. Early humans likely began domesticating wolves, selecting for traits such as tameness and utility in hunting and protection. Over generations, these early domesticated wolves evolved into the diverse range of dog breeds we know today.</p>
    <p>In ancient civilizations, dogs played various roles. In Egypt, they were revered and often mummified with their owners. In Greece and Rome, dogs were used for guarding homes, herding livestock, and as war dogs. Throughout history, dogs have been selectively bred to enhance specific traits, leading to the wide variety of breeds seen today, each with unique characteristics and abilities suited to different tasks.</p>

    <p>As part of our CSP project, we visited a local dog shelter and met with the shelter manager. We were granted permission to survey the shelter, and we spoke with the staff about the various breeds of dogs they care for and their diets. The shelter houses many types of dogs, each with unique needs and characteristics. We provided suggestions on new technologies in dog care and nutrition to improve their well-being.</p>

    <h1>Habits and Food</h1>
    <p>In our research, we found that dogs require a balanced diet that includes proteins, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals. Common foods include commercial dog food, which is formulated to meet their nutritional needs. Additionally, dogs can be fed fresh foods such as meat, vegetables, and grains. We advised the shelter staff on the importance of a balanced diet and proper feeding routines to ensure the dogs' health and vitality.</p>
