    <h1>History of Pigeons</h1>
    <p>Pigeons, also known as rock doves, have a long and rich history with humans. They have been domesticated for thousands of years, initially for food and later for their homing ability. Pigeons played a crucial role in communication during wartime, serving as reliable message carriers. The sport of pigeon racing, which began in the 19th century, further enhanced their importance. Today, pigeons are appreciated for their intelligence, navigational skills, and as pets or racing birds.</p>
    <p>Throughout history, pigeons have been symbols of peace and love in various cultures. They are known for their remarkable homing ability, capable of finding their way back to their nests from long distances. Pigeons have adapted well to urban environments and are a common sight in cities worldwide.</p>

    <p>As part of our CSP project, we visited a local pigeon aviary and met with the aviary manager. We were granted permission to survey the aviary, and we spoke with the staff about the various breeds of pigeons they care for and their diets. The aviary houses many types of pigeons, each with unique needs and characteristics. We provided suggestions on new technologies in pigeon care and nutrition to improve their well-being.</p>

    <h1>Habits and Food</h1>
    <p>In our research, we found that pigeons require a balanced diet that includes grains, seeds, and fresh vegetables. Grains such as corn, wheat, and barley provide essential nutrients, while seeds like sunflower seeds and millet are important for their overall health. Fresh vegetables such as spinach, kale, and carrots offer necessary vitamins and minerals. We advised the aviary staff on the importance of a balanced diet and proper feeding routines to ensure the pigeons' health and vitality.</p>

    <h1>Diseases and Preventions</h1>
    <h4>Pigeons can be affected by various diseases, but here are a few common ones and their preventions:</h4>
    <p><b>Paramyxovirus (PMV):</b> A viral disease that causes neurological symptoms. Prevention includes vaccination and maintaining good hygiene.<br>
        <b>Paratyphoid (Salmonella):</b> A bacterial infection causing diarrhea and lethargy. Preventive measures include good sanitation and regular health checks.<br>
        <b>Canker (Trichomoniasis):</b> A parasitic infection affecting the mouth and throat. Prevention involves maintaining clean water sources and good hygiene.<br>
        <b>Worms:</b> Intestinal parasites that affect digestion. Prevention includes regular deworming and maintaining clean living conditions.</p>
