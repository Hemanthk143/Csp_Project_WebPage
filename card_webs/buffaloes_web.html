    <h1>History of Buffaloes</h1>
    <p>Buffaloes were first tamed in Mesopotamia around 2500 B.C. during the Akkadian dynasty.
        They were also domesticated in the Indus Valley civilization, extending to parts of what is now India and Pakistan.
        By 2500 B.C., river buffaloes were present in India, and by 1000 B.C., in Mesopotamia.
        Swamp-type buffaloes originated in China with a domestication history of about 4000 years.
        River-type buffaloes have their origins in India, with a domestication history of around 5000 years.
        In the Indian subcontinent, buffaloes were well domesticated by the medieval period.
        They were considered milch animals along with cows, goats, and sheep since ancient times.
        The American bison, often called buffalo, is native to North America and is a different species.
        Today, buffaloes are vital for agriculture and dairy production in many parts of the world.</p>

    <p>In our csp project we decided that we get some more information of different Buffalo's breeds which are available for us. 
        The most common breeds used in indian farms and homes are Murrah, Surti, Bhadawari, and Mehsana these are the breeds which are most common and essential breeds in India. 
        Today we got only one breed that is murrah breed. 
        Murrah
        A water buffalo breed that is disease resistant and well-suited to the climate of South India. Murrah buffaloes are often used in commercial and university farms, and are also used to improve the milk production of other dairy buffalo breeds. They are jet black in color, with white markings on their face, tail, and sometimes their extremities. They have tightly curved horns and are known for being efficient milk and butter fat producers.
        Murrah Buffalo milk yield usually ranges from 10 liters per day to 16 liters per day. There are buffaloes which yield more than 16 Liters also but their price will be higher.</p>

    <h1>Habits and Food</h1>
    <p>Buffaloes are known for their robust digestive systems, allowing them to process tough, fibrous plant material. They primarily consume grasses, but their diet can also include herbs, tree leaves, and in scarce times, even mosses and tree bark. Buffaloes require a significant amount of water and will often be found near water sources. They spend a large portion of their day grazing and are constantly on the move to find fresh patches of grass. Their adaptability in diet is crucial for survival, especially during droughts when they switch from grasses to shrubs or aquatic plants. This dietary flexibility helps maintain their energy levels and supports their large size and strength .</p>
